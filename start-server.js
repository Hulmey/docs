  // Warm up as soon as possible.
  // The `warmServer()` function is idempotent and it will soon be used
  // by some middleware, but there's no point in having a started server
  // without this warmed up. Besides, by starting this slow thing now,
  // it can start immediately instead of waiting for the first request
  // to trigger it to warm up. That way, when in development and triggering
  // a `nodemon` restart, there's a good chance the warm up has come some
  // way before you manage to reach for your browser to do a page refresh.
